Davis, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; received July 3, 2023; accepted March 1, 2024 Metrics Total Views388 Significance In the quantum world, it seems there is always a path to escape from a trap, thanks to quantum tunneling. However, counterintuitively, if a second path is also available, the two paths can be arranged so that they destructively interfere with each other, thus blocking the escape. This interference is also a quantum mechanical feature and enters here to null out the freedom provided by quantum tunneling. By controlling the phase difference between the two paths, one can control tunneling in a way that is completely independent of the barrier height, a phenomenon with applications in quantum computation, in molecular and nuclear physics. Our experiment has demonstrated this interference effect in a controlled tunneling double-well system. Abstract We present the experimental finding of multiple simultaneous two-fold degeneracies in the spectrum of a Kerr oscillator subjected to a squeezing drive. This squeezing drive resulting from a three-wave mixing process, in combination with the Kerr interaction, creates an effective static two-well potential in the phase space rotating at half the frequency of the sinusoidal drive generating the squeezing. Remarkably, these degeneracies can be turned on-and-off on demand, as well as their number by simply adjusting the frequency of the squeezing drive. We find that when the detuning Δ between the frequency of the oscillator and the second subharmonic of the drive equals an even multiple of the Kerr coefficient K, Δ/K=2m, the oscillator displays m+1 exact, parity-protected, spectral degeneracies, insensitive to the drive amplitude. These degeneracies can be explained by the unusual destructive interference of tunnel paths in the classically forbidden region of the double well static effective potential that models our experiment. Exploiting this interference, we measure a peaked enhancement of the incoherent well-switching lifetime, thus creating a protected cat qubit in the ground state manifold of our oscillator. Our results illustrate the relationship between degeneracies and noise protection in a driven quantum system.

Notes This article is a PNAS Direct Submission. Note that this adiabaticity condition pertains to the gap between the ground and first excited pair of states. We do not need to be adiabatic with respect to the two tunnel split states within the ground state manifold since they have opposite parity and the parity preserving squeezing drive will not couple them. In the absence of dissipation, the metapotential acquires two wells as soon as ϵ2,Δ>0, i.e., there is no threshold for bifurcation of the driven oscillator. In our quantum experiment, this threshold is finite but is, relatively speaking, extremely small since and is set by ϵ22>(Δ2+T1−2/4)/4 (see ref. 26).
